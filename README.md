By following these steps, you're leveraging Redux Toolkit for state management, possibly complemented by Context API for global non-cart-specific states. The cart's reactive nature (auto-updating quantities and totals) is inherently supported by the way Redux and React work together, ensuring your UI is always in sync with the state. This approach gives you a scalable, maintainable way to handle complex state logic while keeping your components clean and focused on the UI.
